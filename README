RL task in N=25 college age participants.  Data collected circa 2018 in the CRCL at UNM.  The paper [Brown, D.R., Jackson, T.J. & Cavanagh, J.F.  The Reward Positivity is sensitive to affective liking]  Should be coming out in Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience.  Your best bet for understanding this task  would be to read that paper first.  - James F Cavanagh 07/02/2021
